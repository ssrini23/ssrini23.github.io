Welcome! I am a research scientist at the <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/isf/home">Acoustics Research Institute</a>, <a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/">Austrian Academy of Sciences</a>, Vienna, Austria. I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience, an M.S. in Psychology, and an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from the <a href="https://www.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a>, Florida, USA, and my B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from <a href="https://www.b-u.ac.in/">Bharathiar University</a>, India.

My research interests broadly comprise interrelationships between auditory and cognition systems in normal and clinical populations along the lifespan. I utilize a combination of behavioral and psychoacoustic experimental paradigms, augmented with electrophysiological measures to gain understanding of mechanisms of how neural subsystems interact to influence cognition and behavior in the auditory sensory modality. I have teaching experience in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience and Research Methods.
